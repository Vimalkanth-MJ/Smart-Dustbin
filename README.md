Welcome to the **Smart Waste Monitoring System**—an innovative IoT solution designed to revolutionize waste management in hospitals! Powered by ESP32 microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, and a LoRa-based mesh network, this system ensures real-time, energy-efficient monitoring of waste bins, promoting hygiene, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Hospitals generate diverse waste that demands meticulous monitoring to prevent overflow, cross-contamination, and infection risks. Manual monitoring is labor-intensive and inefficient. Our **Smart Waste Monitoring System** leverages cutting-edge IoT technology to automate waste bin monitoring with:

- **Accurate Waste Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors with a moving average algorithm for precise fill-level tracking.
- **Energy Efficiency**: ESP32’s deep sleep mode and IR-triggered wake-ups for battery-powered operation.
- **Reliable Communication**: LoRa-based star topology for robust data transmission to a central master node.
- **Real-Time Insights**: OLED display at the master node for instant waste status updates.

This project is scalable, cost-effective, and built with open-source hardware, making it ideal for hospitals, clinics, and other high-hygiene environments.

## 🛠️ Version 1.0: Current Status

🎉 **Version 1.0 is Complete!**  
The initial version of the Smart Waste Monitoring System is fully implemented and tested in a controlled environment. Check out the [Version 1.0 Demo Video](#) (link to be updated with your video) to see it in action!

### Key Features of Version 1.0
- **Waste Level Detection**: HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors accurately measure bin fill levels.
- **ESP32-Powered Nodes**: Each dustbin node runs on an ESP32 microcontroller for low-power operation.
- **LoRa Star Topology**: Dustbin nodes transmit data to a central master node using LoRa SX1278 modules.
- **OLED Visualization**: The master node displays real-time bin statuses on an OLED screen.
- **Energy Optimization**: Deep sleep mode and IR-triggered wake-ups minimize power consumption.

### How It Works
1. **Node Initialization**: Dustbin nodes remain in deep sleep, waking up via IR proximity sensors or periodic intervals.
2. **Waste Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors measure waste levels, processed with a moving average filter for accuracy.
3. **Data Transmission**: Data is sent to the master node via LoRa in a star topology.
4. **Status Display**: The master node updates the OLED display with bin fill statuses.
5. **Power Management**: Nodes return to deep sleep after transmission to conserve energy.

### Source Code
- **`Master.ino`**: Handles data aggregation from dustbin nodes and OLED display updates.
- **`Dustbin.ino`**: Manages sensor readings, LoRa communication, and power optimization for each dustbin node.

## 🌟 Future Scope

The Smart Waste Monitoring System is designed for scalability and evolution. Here’s what’s planned for future versions:

### Version 2.0
- **True LoRa Mesh Topology**: Enable multi-hop routing for larger hospital areas and low-signal zones.
- **Self-Healing Network**: Dynamic rerouting if nodes fail, with health status monitoring.
- **Smart Alerts**: Notify when bins reach 80% capacity, displayed on OLED and sent via UART/USB.
- **Data Logging**: Store recent readings (e.g., last 10 per bin) using SD card or EEPROM.
- **Advanced Power Management**: Adaptive wake-up based on fill patterns and dynamic LoRa power optimization.
- **Remote Configuration**: Master node sends commands to adjust bin settings (e.g., alert thresholds).

### Final Version (Production-Ready)
- **Full-Scale Mesh with OTA Updates**: Support over-the-air firmware updates and robust node discovery.
- **Cloud Integration**: Push data to platforms like Firebase, AWS IoT, or ThingsBoard for real-time dashboards.
- **Web & Mobile Dashboards**: Live bin status maps and admin panels for remote management.
- **Smart Analytics**: Use ML to predict fill times and optimize collection schedules.
- **Security & Compliance**: Encrypted communication and audit logs for medical regulatory standards.
- **Multimodal Alerts**: Email, SMS, and app notifications for critical events.
- **Maintenance Features**: Predictive alerts for sensor/battery health and QR code scanning for manual inspections.
